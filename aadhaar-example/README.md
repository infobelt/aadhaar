Aadhaar Example Application
=======

This is a sample Spring Boot application which uses Infobelt's Aadhaar library.  The classes in the doamin, repository, 
services, and web (resources) directories all extend the aadhaar base classes, as described in the [aadhaar read me](../README.md).

Swagger API documentation
---------------------     

Once the application has been started, you can view the specific documentation for the
APIs exposed in this example by browsing http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html.  

Note, if you've configured your 
application to run on a port other than 8080, you'll browse the documentation on that port.

Test Setup
---------------------             

The setup of CRUD operation tests is explained in the [aadhaar read me](../README.md)
